  # This option causes graph creation to fail if the metadata of a

  raise-failed-meta: False

  # This option is for cases where new array collections are created
  # with unknown metadata. The default setting is to compute the first
  # partition of the collection so that we can define the metadata. If
  # this option is set to False then collections with unknown metadata
  # will be instantiated with the `_meta` attribute set to an "empty"
  # typetracer, which is an empty awkward array.

  optimization:

    # If true dask-awkward specific optimizations will be run. This is
    # currently limited to determining necessary columns and applying
    # column projection.
    enabled: True

    # This option controls whether or not a warning is thrown, an
    # exception is raised, or if nothing is done if a dask-awkward
    # specific optimization fails (right now this is only the column
    # projection optimization for determining necessary columns). The
    # default value ("warn") will produce a warning if the
    # optimization fails. If this option is set to "raise" and the
    # optimization fails, an exception will be raised intead, crashing
    # a program before an optimized compute. Finally, if the option is
    # set to "pass" and the optimization fails, it will silently fail
    # and the task graph continue on to be computed without
    # dask-awkward specific optimizations.
